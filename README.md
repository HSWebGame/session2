# Session 2 Starter Code - GameCraft

This repository contains starter code for Session 2 of GameCraft.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo (or accept the GitHub Classroom assignment)
2. Open the folder in VS Code
3. Install the **Live Server** extension
4. Follow the tutorial to complete the `TODO` sections in each file

## Files

| File | Description | What You Add |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `click-game.html` | Click Speed Challenge - race against the clock | Event handler, timer logic, end game |
| `gem-catcher.html` | Gem Catcher - catch falling gems with a basket | Collision detection, scoring, gem spawning |

## Getting Started

1. Right-click a `.html` file → **Open with Live Server**
2. Look for `// TODO` comments in the code
3. Follow the hints to fill in the missing pieces
4. Save and your browser will auto-refresh

## Progression

The **Click Speed Game** teaches you:
- Event listeners (`addEventListener`)
- Game state variables (score, timer)
- Conditional logic (`if/else`)
- DOM updates (`textContent`)

The **Gem Catcher** expands those same ideas into an animated game:
- Same score tracking pattern → now with lives too
- Same conditional checks → now for collision detection
- Same event listeners → now for mouse and keyboard movement
- New: Canvas drawing and animation loops

## Solutions

Complete solutions are in the `solutions/` folder (for teacher reference).
